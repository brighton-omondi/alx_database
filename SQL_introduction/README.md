SQL stands for "Structured Query Language," and it is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. SQL is the standard language for interacting with database management systems (DBMS), such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, and many others. It provides a way to:

1. **Create and Modify Databases**: SQL allows you to create databases, define their structure (schemas), and modify them by adding, altering, or deleting tables and their relationships.

2. **Retrieve Data**: SQL provides commands to query data from databases. You can use the SELECT statement to retrieve data from one or more tables.

3. **Insert, Update, and Delete Data**: SQL offers commands to insert new records into a database, update existing records, and delete records.

4. **Define Data Integrity Constraints**: You can define rules to ensure the integrity of your data, such as primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints.

5. **Manage User Access**: SQL allows you to control who can access and modify data by setting up user accounts, permissions, and roles.

6. **Aggregate and Analyze Data**: You can use SQL to perform aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT, AVG) and write complex queries for data analysis and reporting.

SQL is a standardized language, which means that most of its syntax and features are consistent across different relational database management systems. However, each DBMS may also have its own extensions and unique features.

SQL is an essential tool for developers, database administrators, data analysts, and anyone who works with data stored in relational databases. It provides a powerful and flexible means to interact with and manipulate structured data.
